    "arda_khiva_title": "Modern Tourism Complex Opened in Khiva",
    "arda_khiva_description": "Efforts to unlock the tourism potential of Khorezm region are yielding significant results. Compared to seven or eight years ago, the number of foreign tourists visiting the region has increased 30 times. As a result of transformations in the sector, the region's tourism services exports rose from $7 million in 2017 to $380 million last year. In the past, people only thought of Itchan Kala when it came to tourism in the region. Now, perceptions have changed dramatically. Over 40 tourist routes have been developed, and their total number has reached 100. Now, there is a new unique complex — Arda Khiva. Its opening was a major event during the President’s visit to the region. The complex, located within an ancient settlement, resembles a distinctive city. It harmonizes history with modernity through its architectural solution. 'Arda Khiva' was built on a 25-hectare area of low-yield, salty land, adjacent to the 150-hectare Govuk Lake. Green areas are being developed around it to make it more attractive for tourists. The President toured the complex and inspected the construction. Exhibitions of handicrafts, applied arts, and local markets were presented. All necessary amenities have been created for tourists: 20 hotels with a total of 1,000 beds reflecting the atmosphere of an ancient city, indoor and outdoor aquaparks and attractions, an amphitheater with 3,000 seats, and a musical fountain. The complex also features 11 craft houses in historical style, an oriental bazaar, the 'Kukhna Urgench' museum, and boat rides along a 2-km canal. It also includes five cinemas and concert halls, numerous restaurants, a jewelry center, shops and stalls, a water motor tourism zone, and a modern parking area. A unified cooling and heating system serves all buildings, and solar panels have been installed for electricity. The complex can accommodate three million visitors per year and will provide employment for over 2,000 people. While Itchan Kala symbolizes history, 'Arda Khiva' will be Khorezm's modern 'calling card'. The President also held a sincere conversation with Khorezm youth. He emphasized that while underground resources may run out one day, the spiritual and architectural heritage left by ancestors continues to serve the people for centuries. We must use this wealth for the benefit of our nation. Much has been done, but many plans still lie ahead. 'I trust you, the youth,' said President Mirziyoyev. 'If you aim high, gain knowledge, and master modern professions, we will surely achieve our great goals.' The discussion also touched on students’ academic success, dreams, and aspirations.",

    "news_description": "Kyrgyz guests visited ancient Khiva. President of Uzbekistan Shavkat Mirziyoyev and President of Kyrgyzstan Sadyr Japarov, together with the First Ladies of both countries, visited the Ichan Qala complex and the Nurillaboy Palace complex in the city of Khiva. Khiva was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1990, and its 2500th anniversary was celebrated in 1997. The city was named the Cultural Capital of the Turkic World in 2020 and the Tourism Capital of the Islamic World in 2024. Recognized as an “open-air museum,” Khiva is considered the only city in Central Asia that has preserved its architectural integrity. It is home to over 120 historical monuments. The high-ranking guests began their tour from 'Ota Darvoza', exploring the unique 'Kuhna Ark' complex, Shergazi Khan Madrasah, Juma Mosque, 'Toshhovli' complex, and other landmarks. Traditional Uzbek songs were performed and a theatrical show was presented in honor of the guests. The delegation then visited the Nurillaboy Palace. This palace-park complex was built in the early 20th century. It includes a madrasah, over 100 rooms, and galleries. Alongside Khivan master craftsmen, foreign artists and decorators also took part in designing the palace interiors, blending Eastern style with European modernism. The stories about Khiva’s history, its contributions to science, and the rich culture and art of the land left a deep impression on the Kyrgyz guests.",
